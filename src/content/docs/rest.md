The same server over HTTP, so any language can drive it. Nineteen routes, one per
tool, plus the job routes that make a long crawl something you follow rather than
something you hold a connection open for.

Everything runs on your machine. The API calls nothing external, binds loopback by
default, and carries a key it generated itself.

```bash
svipall serve --port 8788
curl -sH "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d '{"url":"https://example.com","query":"pricing"}' localhost:8788/v1/fetch
```

`svipall-mcp` mounts the same router when `rest_port` is set, on its own listener,
sharing one browser pool, one page cache and one set of learned tiers with the MCP
tools. Two ways in, one server behind them.

## What a status code means

> **A blocked page is a 200**
> The call ran; the *page* did not. A client that read a wall as a `5xx` would sit
> in a retry loop against something that is never going to move.

| Status | Means |
|---|---|
| **200** | the call ran, including every unhappy page: `blocked_reason`, `quality: "thin"`, `count: 0` |
| **202** | an asynchronous job was queued; `Location` names it |
| 400 | the body is not this endpoint's shape |
| 401 | missing or wrong bearer key |
| 403 | the request carried a browser `Origin`, or a `Host` that is not loopback on a loopback bind |
| 404 | unknown path, or a job id that does not exist |
| 413 | body over 2 MB |
| **500** | *this installation* could not carry the request out: no page cache, no browser, an unknown country code. Something the operator can fix — never a wall |

Unknown body fields are ignored rather than rejected, which is what MCP clients
already get. A mistyped field is therefore silent. That is deliberate, and it is the
price of one behaviour across both protocols.

## The key, and why loopback is not a boundary

Every route needs `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, including on loopback. Svipall
carries logged-in browser profiles, cookies and your exit address, so an
unauthenticated port is a proxy wearing your identity, reachable by every process on
the machine.

The key is resolved in this order:

1. `SVIPALL_API_KEY` — beats everything, and needs no writable home. The container
   and CI path.
2. `api_key` in `~/.svipall/config.toml`, if you pinned one.
3. `~/.svipall/api_key`, written by an earlier run.
4. Otherwise one is generated, written to `~/.svipall/api_key` at `0600` where the
   platform allows, and **printed once** on the run that made it.

It lives beside `config.toml` rather than in it because `Config` is not serialised:
writing a generated key back would mean rewriting a file you edit by hand, comments
and all.

### The two checks in front of the key

A page you have open at `evil.test` can be served a DNS answer of `127.0.0.1`. Its
script then posts to `http://evil.test:8788/v1/route` and the *browser* delivers it
to loopback — binding to `127.0.0.1` does not help, because the request originates
on your box.

The key is the real defence, since a page cannot read it. But a `POST` with a
`text/plain` body is preflight-exempt and is therefore *sent* regardless, which is
enough for an endpoint with side effects. So:

- Any request carrying an `Origin` header is **403**. No browser page is a
  legitimate client of this API, there is no CORS layer, and there will not be one.
- On a loopback bind, a `Host` that is not `localhost` / `127.0.0.1` / `[::1]` is
  **403**. The attacker's page has to send `Host: evil.test`, and that is the tell.

On a non-loopback `rest_bind` the `Host` check is skipped — your LAN address is a
legitimate host — and a warning is printed at startup saying the key is now the only
thing between the network and this machine's profiles.

## Routes

| Route | Body |
|---|---|
| `POST /v1/fetch` | `web_fetch`'s params |
| `POST /v1/fetch_many` | `web_fetch_many`'s |
| `POST /v1/crawl` | `web_crawl`'s, plus `"async": true` |
| `POST /v1/search` · `/v1/site_search` · `/v1/map` | finding things |
| `POST /v1/snapshot` · `/v1/act` · `/v1/capture` · `/v1/screenshot` | a real browser |
| `POST /v1/solve_and_continue` | the captcha, answered on the blocked page |
| `POST /v1/diff` · `/v1/watch` · `/v1/notes` · `/v1/log` | memory |
| `POST /v1/route` · `/v1/profile` · `/v1/browser_setup` | configuration |
| `GET` / `POST /v1/status` | `GET` is read-only by construction: `WebStatusParams` carries three *clearing* fields, and a `GET` is wired to defaults so it cannot reach them |
| `GET /v1/health` | the one route with no key, so a container healthcheck does not need one |

`/v1/screenshot` returns the JSON `web_screenshot` returns — including `path`, since
the PNG is written to disk either way — plus `image_base64` when the picture is
small enough to be worth carrying. That threshold is decided once, in the seam, so
MCP and REST cannot disagree about it.

### Not routes, and why

`rest::NOT_IN_REST` records the reason beside each name, and a conformance test
fails the build if a new tool is neither a route nor listed there.

- **`browser_open` / `browser_do` / `browser_close`** — a session is a resource HTTP
  cannot bound. It would work: the browser pool is shared, so a session opened by
  one request is visible to the next. That is the problem. A client that dies
  between `open` and `close` leaks a real browser process with no TTL and no cap.
  `web_act` covers the single-shot case.
- **`web_login`** — opens a visible window on your desktop and waits up to an hour
  for a person. An HTTP request must not be able to do that.
- **the `solve_*` token family** — already answers on `dashboard_port` in the
  2captcha wire shape. Two contracts for one queue, with two auth schemes and two
  error conventions, is how a caller ends up unsure which one it is talking to.

## Long crawls

A crawl of two hundred pages is minutes. Synchronous is still the default — it is
what MCP does and what a script expects — but `"async": true` hands back an id.

```bash
curl -sH "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d '{"url":"https://docs.example/","max_pages":200,"async":true}' localhost:8788/v1/crawl
# 202, Location: /v1/jobs/9f2c1a4be7d0435a
```

| Route | |
|---|---|
| `GET /v1/jobs?state=&limit=` | a listing. **Never carries `result`** — ten finished 200-page crawls would be tens of megabytes of pages nobody asked for twice |
| `GET /v1/jobs/{id}` | the row, plus `result` once it is terminal. While it runs, `pages_done` is the honest partial answer; you are never handed a fabricated result |
| `GET /v1/jobs/{id}/stream` | the same job as Server-Sent Events |
| `DELETE /v1/jobs/{id}` | ask it to stop |

### The id is the crawl id

For a crawl, `job_id` **is** `crawl_id`. One handle to learn, one id in every log
line, and resuming is the vocabulary the MCP tool and the CLI already use.

The server mints the id; `POST /v1/crawl` does not accept a new one.
`resume_or_start` does not validate a supplied id — an unknown one silently starts a
fresh crawl under it — so letting a client choose would be letting it choose this
server's primary key.

### States

```text
queued ──claimed──> running ──┬── finished     the frontier drained
                              ├── stopped      a budget: max_pages, time, tokens,
                              │                saturation, or over_budget
                              ├── cancelled    the crawl saw the flag
                              ├── interrupted  the process that owned it is gone
                              └── failed       the task panicked
```

**`interrupted` is the state this whole design exists for.** A crawl was always
resumable — `crawl_queue` has survived a kill since crawls were written — but
`crawl.status` is set to `running` per batch and *nothing ever clears it*, so there
was no way to tell a crawl that died from one that finished.

The job row is that missing fact. It is detected by two things together: the row is
owned by another run, **and** its heartbeat has gone quiet for five minutes. Both
halves are needed, because two Svipall processes can share one database, and because
`crawl.updated_at` is written per batch — a level of two hundred pages can be half an
hour between writes. The heartbeat is written per page.

An `interrupted` job is resumed like any other: submit its id again.

### Cancelling

`DELETE` sets a flag in the row — durable, survives a restart — and, if the job is
running here, flips the one the crawl reads. The crawl checks it at two points, both
places it is already between things: the top of a batch, and the end of a page
*after that page's links have been queued*. It then leaves through its ordinary
exit, so the frontier is written and the id can be picked up again.

It never aborts the task. `web_act` and `web_capture` close their browser page on
the normal path only, so killing a fetch mid-flight would leak a CDP page into the
pool.

`DELETE` answers **200** with the state the job was in, including for a job that had
already finished: you wanted to know whether you stopped a running crawl or reaped a
finished one, and both are answers.

### The stream

```text
event: snapshot
data: {"id":"9f2c…","state":"running","pages_done":41,"pending":118, …}

event: progress
data: {"job_id":"9f2c…","kind":"page","pages_done":42,"total":200,"queued":117,
       "url":"https://docs.example/guide","tier":"http","status":200}

event: done
data: {"id":"9f2c…","state":"finished","pages_done":57,"pending":0}
```

The first frame is **always** a `snapshot` built from the store, never from the
channel. That is the one way this stream could lie: a subscriber joining at page
forty and inferring "this started at zero" from the first live event would draw a
bar from the beginning of work that is nearly done.

It is a snapshot rather than a replay, deliberately. Full replay needs a durable
event log written per page and trimmed by the housekeeper — real cost for a consumer
that is a progress bar — and what a late subscriber actually needs is where the job
is *now*. There is no `Last-Event-ID`.

A `progress` event never carries the page. A crawl of two hundred pages that put its
markdown in every event would stream its whole result twice; each event stays under
half a kilobyte, and a test enforces that.

A subscriber that falls behind gets `event: lagged` with how many it missed, not a
closed connection. And a listener can never slow or stop a crawl: the send is
non-blocking and errors when nobody is listening, which is the ordinary case.

Subscribing to a job that has already ended gives you `snapshot` then `done`, then
the stream closes — never a hang. An unknown id is a 404 before any stream opens.

### One crawl per site

`max_jobs` (default 2) caps how many jobs run at once. Deliberately not
`parallelism`, which bounds requests *inside* one job: two crawls at parallelism 4 is
eight in-flight fetches and, on a browser tier, eight Chrome pages.

On top of that, **a queued job whose site already has a job running is not started.**
The pacer already prevents a burst, but what it cannot prevent is two jobs spending
one address's reputation with one host twice as fast.

> **This rule came from an incident**
> This project's own benchmark lost a target by running its lists eight times
> against one address in a day. The rule is decided by the database, from the domain
> recorded when the job was queued, so a restart cannot forget it.

`core::reputation` now keeps what each address has spent with each host, decaying
with a half-life, and slows down before declining. `max_jobs` and the one-crawl-per-
site rule still stop two jobs spending the same budget twice as fast, but the budget
is what bounds the total.

## Configuration

```toml
rest_port = 0                # 0 = off. `svipall serve` starts it anyway; this is
                             # what makes svipall-mcp mount it too.
rest_bind = "127.0.0.1"
api_key = ""                 # empty = ~/.svipall/api_key, generated on first use
max_jobs = 2
```

`SVIPALL_REST_PORT` and `SVIPALL_API_KEY` override the first and third.

## What `svipall serve` does not do yet

The 60-second housekeeping loop that reaps idle browsers, trims the request log and
evicts old profiles lives in `svipall-mcp`'s `main`, and has not been moved. Under
`svipall serve` the job runner keeps its own house — orphan adoption, job expiry —
but browsers are not reaped and the log is not trimmed. Run the REST API from
`svipall-mcp` with `rest_port` set if that matters to you.

`solve_and_continue` under `svipall serve` also has no human dashboard behind it: the
CLI opens no solver database. Local models still answer; a challenge none of them can
answer has nowhere to go.
